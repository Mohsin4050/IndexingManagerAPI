I have created an Indexing Manager API module for a peer to peer network. It will perform tasks of adding,deleting,updating and searching an Index entry. It will also run a maintenance thread to purge an entry depending on its timer type and time defined by user. I have used BouncyCastle provider for Cryptographic functions.
